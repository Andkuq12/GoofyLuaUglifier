<u>GoofyLuaUglifier - Website</u>
```
This is some kind of Lua Uglifier and also bit Obfuscator, idk.
I'm just bored and doing some "obfuscation methods" or whatever you could call it.

# Try Out
- You can try it out on [my Website](https://mopsfl.de/GoofyLuaUglifier/)
- Or you can use my [API (soon)](https://mopsfl.de)

# Important
- Website not working right now because repl.it decided to be a dickhead and remove free hosting. Now I have to buy a VPS. ðŸ˜¢ (i will somewhere in the future)

# Notes
###### Still in development, means some things dont work yet or might be broken!
###### The source code of the actual "uglifier" is not open source. Maybe I'll make it in the future.
