# GoofyLuaUglifier - Website
> This is some kind of Lua Uglifier and also bit Obfuscator, idk. I'm just bored and doing some "obfuscation methods" or whatever you could call it.
> 
## Website not working right now because repl.it decided to be a dickhead and remove free hosting. Now I have to buy a VPS. ðŸ˜¢ (i will somewhere in the future)

###### Still in development, means some things dont work yet or might be broken!
###### The source code of the actual uglifier is not open source. Maybe I'll make it in the future.
